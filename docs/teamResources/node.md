# Node JS

We'll be running our server on NodeJS. While we won't use a ton of Node's capabilities directly, we'll use packages that build on top of it. To start, go download and install [Node v4.5.0 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

This will come with Node Package Manager. I will be installing the packages and dependancies that we'll be using, so you don't have to worry about that. For now, all you'll need to know is how to install the packages.

> npm install

This will take all the dependancies from the package.json file and install them for you. The package.json file is the npm config file.

I'll be expanding this file as the need arrises. We'll be using npm to run our tests and such.
