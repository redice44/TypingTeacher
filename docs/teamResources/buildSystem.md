# Build System

We'll be using webpack for our build system. It's a pretty in depth piece of software, but I'll be handling getting that up and running for us. All you'll need to do is run the command to get it going, and it will build our project for us. More on the workflow later.

> npm run watch

This will watch specific files for changes and apply the appropriate transformations to build the project.
